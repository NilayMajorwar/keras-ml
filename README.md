# keras-ml
A collection of machine learning models implemented with the Keras framework in Python.
The files are in Python Notebook (.ipynb) format.

## Models

#### 1. MNIST Model
A machine learning model that recognizes handwritten digits using the Keras framework, with ~100% accuracy.
Uses a convolutional neural network (CNN) and data is taken from the MNIST dataset.

#### 2. Cifar-10 Model
A machine learning model that classifies 32 x 32 RGB images into one of ten categories (car, dog, etc), using the Keras framework, with ~55% accuracy.
Uses a convolutional neural network (CNN) and data is taken from the Cifar-10 dataset.
